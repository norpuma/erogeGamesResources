# Friendly Social Interactions
Friendly Interactions are a special kind of Social Interaction (See SocialInteractions__Basics.md).

They has several Relationships, several Levels, several Actions and several Transitions.

Friendly Interactions happen on a simple, often public social context.

Friendly Interactions most often involves Influencing a partner's Mood and often gaining Intimacy and Trust.

Friendly Interactions help change a character's Mood.

The goal Friendly Interactions is one of the following:
- Put a target in the right state of mind (affecting Mood); this is often a prologue to a Prompt or Request.
- Change a Belief.
- Gain information (Key Knowledge or Secret; through Inquiry or Tests).
- Change the Relationship (usually increasing Depth/Intimacy).
- Seduction (expose Traits, establish History of Actions).

## Basics
Characters are, usually, open to friendly interactions with no requirements.

Interactions in the Friendly context are Small Talk, Revelations and Enquiries. They aim at changing a target's Mood and Affection, to getting a closer relationship (increasing Intimacy) and to find out things about a target. They can also be used to change how a target sees the character (with Boast, Flattery, Revelations and others).

Sympathy levels usually determine how much time a character will spend with another and what an impact meeting with a sympathetic target will influence a character's mood.

Sympathy can be influenced by more than a character's actions. A reputation, physical appearance or observed actions towards others can all influence Sympathy.

Trust levels usually determine how much a character is willing to reveal about themselves. It may also influence circumstances in which the character will meet a target (alone with the target, for instance). Some characters also want Trust before they are willing to start Sensual Activities with a target.

Trust is almost entirely dependent on Intimacy Actions. A character often needs a level of Sympathy before they will allow Intimacy actions.

## Profiles and Templates

## Friendly Relationships
Friendship Relationships track Sympathy, Trust and Safety.

### Sympathy
Sympathy measures how much a character wants to interact with a target in a friendly context - how pleased the character is to interact with the target. Characters may have to interact with targets they don't find Sympathetic in a variety of circumstances, commonly having to Collaborate (work together at a job, study together for a school project or hangout due to having friends in common).

The more Sympathy a character has for a target, the more they want to spend time together and feel Happy to see them and interact with them.

This can often influence Happy/Sad metrics.

Characters take Beguile actions to improve a target's Sympathy for them.

#### Sympathy Levels
- Disgusted -3
- Scornful -2
- Irritated -1
- Indifferent 0
- Pleased 1
- Appreciative 2
- Fascinated 3

### Trust
Trust measures how much a character believes a target will keep their word. This guides a character to confide in a target and reveal key information and secrets.

Trust also measures how much the character believes a target will keep their word and fulfill Promises and Threats. If Trust is high and Safety is low, only the word is trusted, but not the intentions.

Both Safety and Trust can be used to estimate how much a character will reveal their concerns, feelings and beliefs with a target. In the case of Trust, a promise is required.

Characters can take Intimacy actions to improve a target's Trust for them.

Characters often keep a taly of the number of times a target has broken their word to them.

Characters often test how trustworthy targets are by revealing minor juicy secrets and seeing how they are handled.

Trust can influence Arguing.

#### Trust Levels
Mythomaniac -3
Liar -2
Untrustworthy -1
Unknown 0
Trustworthy 1
Reiable 2
Honorable 3

- Trust -3: The target seems incapable of saying the truth, ever.
- Trust -2: The target more often lies than say the truth.
- Trust -1: The target is known to lie. The target is known to have broken their word more often than having kept it. The target will keep their word if it is not bothersome to do so.
- Trust 0: The target is an unknown.
- Trust 1: The target is known to have kept their word more often than having broken it. The target will keep their word will keep their word out of principle. The character believes the target will behave to keep a Minor Revelation safe.
- Trust 2: The target rarely if ever broke their word and what they say can often be assumed to be the truth.
- Trust 3: The character is not known to have broken their word, even when having a great opportunity to do so and at the risk of a big Punishment or the loss of a big Reward. Even unlikely claims by the character are believed.

### Safety
Safety measures how much a character believes a target wants to keep them safe. This indicates how much a character can expose their vulnerabilities to the target.

Both Safety and Trust can be used to estimate how much a character will reveal their concerns, feelings and beliefs with a target. In the case of Safety, no promise is required.

Safety is both a measure of a target's intentions and capabilities. A well-intentioned but week character can be seen as only Safe, while an ill-intentioned and weak (or with little influence) character will be seen as Risky.

Safety can indicate in what environments the character is comfortable with the target. This can be adjusted by Desire.

#### Safety Levels
Persecutor -3
Adversary -2
Rival -1
Risky 0
Safe 1
Defender 2
Protector 3

- Safety -3: The character is sure the target has bad intentions towards them and will act on those on the first occasion.
- Safety -2: The character believes the target will behave in socially acceptable ways, at least for as long as there are witnesses nearby.
- Safety -1: The character believes the target will behave in socially acceptable ways even if there are no other people around.
- Safety 0: The character doesn't know what to believe of the target. Okay to see target in public places.
- Safety 1: The character believes the target will not act against the characer's interests. Okay to see target in private places.
- Safety 2: The character believes the target will not act against them even if they have power over them and interest in doing so. Okay to see target in intimate places.
- Safety 3: The character believes the target will put themselves at risk to protect them.

## Changing Relationships - Friendly Activities and Actions
Characters will often try to change their relationships with targets.
### Conversations
Conversations constitute the most fundamental Friendly Social Interactions.

A character that refuses to engage in a Conversation with a target will usually participate in no other Social Interactions.

A Conversation may be used to Influence a target. This can be done under the guise of small talk, as a character mentions safe Topics to increase the number of interactions an establish a base level (a Depth) in their relationship. Character may select Small Talk Topics to Entertain a target, making them Happy and making them satisfied with an interaction, allowing more interactions to happen in the future.

A Conversation may be used to make Enquiries of a target. This can be used to acquire Revelations about a target - during a conversation, however, a character is unlikely to offer Revelations with a high Hidden value. By selecting the proper Small Talk Topics, a character may learn a lot about a target, in particular Preferences, Beliefs, some Traits and their History.

A Conversation may be used to Argue a point. This is used to change a target's Beliefs. Arguing once will very rarely change a target's Belief and can often upset a target, but it can be used to change a target with minimum chances of trauma.

A Conversation may be used to offer Revelations. This is used to expose a Trait - real or faked - to a target with more or less subtlety. This is important to change a what a target thinks of a character, changing the Target Model of the relationship from the target's perspective.

#### Small Talk Topics
During a conversation, each participant will propose a Topic. A Topic proposed by a character will either Entertain or Bore a target.

Typically, characters have 3 Entertaining Topics and 3 Boring Topics in their Conversation Template.

Topics may also lead a character to talk about something else, opening up more Topics for future Conversations.

Finding the right topics to talk to a target about will allow a character to raise the target's Sympathy for them.

#### Arguing
Arguing is an attempt to Destroy or Create a Belief in a target. If a target already has a Contrary Belief to one the character wants to create, the Contrary Belief must first be Destroyed.

Destroying a Belief will usually upset a target, either making them Angry or Sad. Creating an upsetting Belief will also make the target either Angry or Sad.

Targets always resist having their Beliefs changed, meaning that no all attempts at Arguing will be successful. A character usually needs to *successfully* Argue a Belief 5 times to successfully change it.

Getting a target to change their Attitude frequently requires a character to change 2-4 Key Beliefs. Therefore identifying Key Beliefs is important to avoid wasting time arguing irrelevant points.

#### Influencing
Influence is usually done by simply selecting the right Small Talk Topics to properly change a target's Mood. The most fundamental Influence is simply to chose Entertaining Topics and making the target Happy.

There may be scenes where a character can select Topics to purposefully make a target Sad, or Envious or, maybe, Angry at some other character.

#### Enquirying
Enquiries are essential to understanding a target. Understanding a target, learning about their Preferences, their Beliefs and their Traits make other activities, such as Arguing and Influencing more effective. It can also help when the character wants to offer Gifts, Flattery or even when having sex.

Targets will judge how Hidden any piece of information (Topic, Preference, Trait or Belief) is and this will influence how willing they will be to Reveal some information when prompted by an Enquiry. Trust and Safety play a strong role in this. See Interrogation in SocialInteractions__PowerInteractions.md to learn about not-so-friendly Enquiries.

Stating a truth about a target to prompt them to admit or refute it can be more effective than simply Prompting a target with an Enquiry, but it also has a greater chance of backfiring and making the target upset.

During conversations, Enquiries are considered a Prompt of the type Suggestion.

#### Revelations
A character may chose to Reveal something during a conversation either Spontaneously or when Prompted. Characters usually reveal Preferences, Traits, Beliefs and History and they may chose to offer either a Truthful or a Deceptive Revelation.

A character will chose to offer a Spontaneous Revelation when they believe this will change the target's perspective of them for the better. Characters will do this, for instance, to reveal they have a lot of Wealth, or that they are very Generous. A Spontaneous Revelation will, usually, be seen as a Boasting, unless the character is good at Social. This will also Reveal the character to be Boastful.

A character will chose to offer a Prompted Revelation after a target has used an Enquiry. The character may not perceive the Enquiry, but if they do, they may chose to lie, creating a false conviction on the target.

* Expose Trait
- Admit (proudly, humbly)
- Boast
- Subtly Mention
- Openly Mention (proudly, humbly)
- Demonstrate

#### Tests/Checks
A character may chose to Test a target to attempt to identify a Trait. This is commonly done through conversation and with the intention of being subtle. Inquirying is a Test with no subtlety.
