Power Interactions govern how a target reacts to a character's COMMANDS. It may also govern some of the INITIATIVES of a character, the actions they will decide to do on their own, without a specific prompting. Pleas (Begging), Requests and Suggestions are not covered by this.

Most characters are resistant to Commands from Strangers and they only accept them from characters with whom they have specific kinds of interactions.
