# What do I want out of an eroge game?
- Arousal. Arousing scenes. Arousing scenes have hot models. Arousing scenes have arousing themes like powerplay. Arousing scenes have hot pictures. Arousing scenes have hot descriptions of sex.
- Engagement. Keeping me involved from one arousing scene to the other requires some elements. Wanitng ot see the results of my actions is engaging. Wanting to know the end of a story is engaging. Wanting to see how the game will put a given character in a sex scene is engaging.
- Immersion. To feel immersed, I must find the game consistent.

# Setup
- Defines a tone. Sets up some of the expectations. Often presents some characters that the player will be willing to wait for some time to find out how they are put in sex scenes.
- As a starting point, consistency will start circling around this. After a time, the start may be irrelevant and more "localized" consistency may be more important (e.g. the Forgotten Paradise game - starts talking about some drug that erases your memory, but the interaction betweeen characters in the spaceship becomes more relevant).

# Story
- Should not take too long to present a first sex scene, otherwise loses engagement.
- Should create a level of anticipation in the player. Anticipation of how the story will develop and anticipation as to what kind of sex scenes will soon be shown - both presenting characters and situations help create the right expectations.
- Should have a level of predictability (should flow naturally from the setup and build up on previous scenes - although a level of "surprise" is allowed). Avoid breaking tone. Avoid breaking consistency. Grinding often serves to setup some predictability.
- Should offer a sense of progress. All scenes should not all look the same.
- Should be planned with a specific number of key scenes. Create something like 8 key scenes for the entire game and build around those. Force choices to collapse back into the key scenes. Allow a very limited number of outcomes/story ends.
- Select specific storylines to pursue.

# Scenes
- Should not take too long to present the sexy part if there is any.
- Should avoid being too "verbose". Prefer straight to the point when possible. Minimal setup. Tropes help with this.
- Should have a specific tone.
- Should have a limited number of branching options to avoid confusing the player and making game writing impossible.
- Should have fewer outcomes than choices. Some choices should flow back into a limited number of outcomes.

# Branching
- Should involve as many meaninful choices as possible. Avoid meaningless choices.
- Should seem more expansive than actually is.
- Should have a limited number of branching options to avoid confusing the player and making game writing impossible.
- Should have fewer outcomes than choices. Some choices should flow back into a limited number of outcomes.
- Should give the illusion of a lot of control.
- Select specific storylines to pursue.

# Dialog
- I'm not great at it. Try to avoid writing too much of it.
- Should have a good ratio of information to noise.

# Game Aspects
- Should involve meaningful choices.
- Should involve thematic choices. Don't ask math questions for a space traveling game except for the very limited scope of minigames. And, then, keep minigames short and not too numerous.
- Should offer adequate rewards. If winning is hard, losing must be fun.
- Should be removed when unnecessary. Don't create a mega life simulator just to create a mega life simulator. Be deliberate about choices when creating game aspects.
- When in doubt, let the player do whatever they want.
- Don't force choices when there is no need to.
- Do not fence interesting parts of the game behind choices without a good reason. Be deliberate about this.

# Something Unlimited
## Questions
### Why is it a good game?
- Presents most of your targets from the start and makes you work to pursue those prizes.
- Doesn't make the player feel overwhelmed by choices.
- LOTS of scenes.
### What are the fun parts of the game?
- Great art.
- Shows famous characters engaged in sex acts.
- Makes the player feel powerful. The story and dialogues are key to creat this feeling.
- Powerplay (and mind control) is a fundamental part of the story.
### What should have been different? (be very clear and deliberate how it whould have made the game better)
- Finding some of the sex scenes shouldn't be hidden behind an arcane sequence of choices and pre-requisites. It's okay to make the player work to reach a goal, but the search shouldn't be tedious and frustrating.
- After enough characters were introduced, there was no need for SO MUCH GRINDING. Whenever possible, one choice lead to one sexy content should be enough.
- Parts of dialogues feel like a chore to go through. Dialogues can be more straightforward or be interesting/sexy/arousing whenever present.
- Interesting parts should be hidden away. Either let the player make a choice before an interesting part so that they stop skipping or let them rollback when they realize the dialog reached an interesting part.
- The game quickly feels repetitive. There is no branching. Only the order of the scenes can change. There is no replayability.
- There are too many scenario elements that are meaningless. STAR Labs should not be offered as a clickable choice if it is almost never used. Robotics should not appear in the underground lab if there is nothing to do there even after 20 hours of play. Those parts should be introduced only when they are relevant.
- There could be a limited number of climaxes per day. This would make grinding actually *more* palatable, making the player pass days without feeling so frustrated.
- Related story parts should give indications that they are related. If having Galatea as a henchwoman can lead to an interesting scene when you go visit Supergirl in her cell there should be hints to that. Hints that appear clearly enough that there can be no doubt and they should be presented again from time to time if the player doesn't get the hint.

# Love and Sex
## Questions
### Why is it a good game?
- Has a huge cast of potential love interests.
- Does a decent job of creating the illusion of a life simulator.
- Has a very interesting locations system.
- Has a very scalable scripting system for girls.
### What are the fun parts of the game?
- Nice art.
- Allows the player to build a harem, having a lot of girl as regular sex partners.
### What should have been different? (be very clear and deliberate how it whould have made the game better)
- Grinding with little guidance on how to succeed. If the grinding is long, making bad choices makes it intolerable.
- Grinding with few intermediary interesting scenes. If the grinding is long, it should offer small and interesting rewards along the way.
- Choices don't seem meaningful. There is a lot of dialogs, but the point to them is not clear.
- Too much is presented at once and a lot of it don't matter for a long time. The car dealership is presented early in the game, but there is nothing to do there. There is nothing interesting at the park for a long time and when there starts being interesting things to do there, the player is not alerted. The player can't go to the gym from the start and getting there is not locked behind interesting choices, but locked by random chance.
- Too many interesting things are locked behind random numbers instead of interesting choices. There is content enough to make progression much better planned and deliberate. Let there be a story reason for the Gym to be found. Let there be a story reason for when Sasha goes play with the Harpies for the first time. Let there be a story reason for when the player first meets Palla. Don't present the girls all at once, but make their introduction be related to some form of progress. The Lust and Power game does this well.

# Labrats
## Questions
### Why is it a good game?
- Content is delivered at a good pacing. Not great, but good.
- Corruption of girls feels very satisfying. The player feels like they are progressing in interesting directions and they feel like their choices matter.
- The game offers multiple endings in a way that the player can understand how they is getting to them.
- Dialogs are compelling.
### What are the fun parts of the game?
- Nice art.
- Corruption of girls feels very satisfying. It is quite arousing.
- There is a great sense of power in corrupting girls.
### What should have been different? (be very clear and deliberate how it whould have made the game better)
- Choices don't actually matter much. There is a sense of wasted potential after a time, when the player realizes that they can't control the flow of the story, only the order of events.
- The player doen't control the interaction between NPCs. It should be possible to decide how sister interacts with mother. It should be possible to decide how Stephany and Nora interact. It should be possible to decide to bring Alexis in on some of the other character's dynamics.
- After enough content is introduced, there should be no need for so much grinding.
