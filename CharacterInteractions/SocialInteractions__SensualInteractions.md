# Sensual Interactions
Sensual Interactions are a special kind of Social Interaction (See SocialInteractions__Basics.md).

Sensual Interactions have two subcontexts:
- Non-Sexual Sensual Interactions
- Sexual Sensual Interactions

# Non-Sexual Sensual Interactions
Non-Sexual Sensual Interactions consist of Flirting, Dating and initiating Romantic Committments.

Flirting is just an application of Seduction with a special purpose (see SocialInteractions__Basics.md).

Dating is an explicit attempt by a character to show themself to have the qualities necessary for Sexual Interactions and/or Romantic Commitments.



Desire, Arousal, Love


## Flirting
Flirting is the same as the Seduction Activity, see SocialInteractions__Basics.md.

Characters attempt to display qualities that will make a target willing to make out or to go on a date. For Making Out Profile see SocialInteractions__SexualInteractions.md. For Dating find the section of the same name in this file.

Additionally, during Flirting, a character may attempt to increase a target's Arousal.

## Dating
Characters invite others on Dates to attempt to display qualities that make them suitable partners for the Makeout Activity, Sexual Contact Activity and Romantic Commitments. For Making Out Profile and Sexual Contact Profile see SocialInteractions__SexualInteractions.md. For Dating and Romantic Commitments find the sections of the same name in this file.

A Date may be very one-sided with one participant making all the effort to satisfy the other.

Characters can make special concessions for first dates before participants know one another much, or a date may be grudgingly accepted by one of the participants, often as a concession to the other after much insistence or in exchange for something.

Some characters only consider Sexual Contact and Intercourse with a partner after Courting and a certain number of satisfying Dates.

It is mostly based on Arousal and Stimulating Acts - both Physical Stimuli  and Psychological Stimuli

Making Out, Sexual Contact, Intercourse, Climaxing, Pushing Boundaries

## Stimuli
### Physical Stimuli
There is a very large number of possible stimuli and characters can have any number of kinks relating to them.

A simple implementation lists erogenous zones (common and some uncommon ones) and allows characters to chose which erogenous zone to stimulate and with what intensity (rough or soft, for simplicity's sake). If the erogenous zone is Dulled, a Rough stimulus can bring a nice feeling there, while a soft one is irrelevant. If an erogenous zone is Sensitive, a Rough stimulus will be too much and will actually decrease arousal (while a rough stimlus on an Overly Sensitive zone will probably cause pain and have the target interrupt the act altogether) and a Soft stimulus will bring just the right kind of sensation. For added complexity, erogenous zones may increase or decrease in sensibility by one degree in some circumstances (including Arousal levels), imagine, for instance an oversensitive clitoris or penis-head just after a climax.
