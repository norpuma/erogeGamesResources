# Social Interactions
Social interactions are tracked between two individuals with the possibility of witnesses and participants.

Social interactions determine a character's Mood and the Relationship (see Relationships.md) between two individuals.

Acts will influence Mood and Relationship either temporarily or in the long term.

## Social Interaction Contexts
- Friendly
- Power
- Sensual
There are three kinds of contexts for Relationships: Friendly, Power and Sensual.

Interactions in the Friendly context are Small Talk, Revelations and Investigations. They aim at changing a target's Mood and Affection, to getting a closer relationship (increasing Intimacy) and to find out things about a target. They can also be used to change how a target sees the character (with Boast, Flattery, Revelations and others).

Interactions in the Power context are Assignments, Task Evaluations, Rewards and Punishments. They aim at getting targets to DO things, to changing a target's Obedience, avoiding Punishment and earning Rewards.

Interactions in the Sensual context are Flirting, Making Out, Sexual Contact, Intercourse and Pushing Boundaries. They aim at changing a targets Arousal and Attraction.

## Getting Acquainted - Creating Relationships
The first kind of Interactions two characters have is getting Acquainted. This immediately creates a Relationship between them.

### Approaching Interactions
Characters may make the Acquaintance of one another either with Hearing About/Learning Of, Observing, Third Party Introduction or Introduction.

#### First Impressions
A character only gets one chance to cause a First Impression. Any other attempt at First Impression is ignored.

- Smiling Stranger: This is a First Impression tactic. It exposes Charm. It also exposes Confidence or Timidity.
- Peacocking: This is a First Impression tactic. It exposes Appearance (Care, Wealth and Fitness). It also exposes Boasting and Confidence.
- Loud Boast: This is a First Impression tactic. It exposes whatever quality is the boast is about. It also exposes Boasting, of course.
- Polite Introduction: This is a First Impression tactic. It exposes Politeness, Confidence and Submissiveness.
- Cheeky/Teasing Introduction: This is a First Impression tactic. It exposes Charm and Confidence at the cost of causing a mildly negative Mood.
- Disrespectful Introduction: This is a First Impression tactic. It exposes Confidence and Dominance at the cost of causing a mildly negative Mood. It impacts the target's Confidence and may help establish Dominance in the Relationship.

##### Approaching
Approaching a character is a relevant element of Sensual Interactions.

Characters may opt for the simple approach of Polite Introduction, going up to the target and offering an introduction, trying to be polite and pleasant. This has the advantage of rarely failing to allow more steps, even for characters with little Charming skills. It has the disadvantage of portraying the character as "Weak" and "Polite" which is not very exciting.

Characters may opt for the more daring strategy of Brash Introduction, trying not to show any weakness, using humor or playing for the crowd to justify an amount of impoliteness. This has the advantage of not showing any weakness. It has the disadvantage of requiring some Charm to ensure a welcome.

Characters may opt for the very risky tactic of Offensive Introduction, immediately challenging the target for power at the risk of making them upset. This has the advantage of challenging the target and giving the character a chance of appearing "Powerful" or "Dominant" and immediately increasing the target's submission to the character. It has the disadvantage of, without a lot of Charm, making the target upset and unwilling to interact until they calm down.

Characters may opt for the traditional method of Peacoking, not going up to the target, but, instead, drawing attention to themself and trying to entice the target to approach the character. This has the advantage of immediately showing a Trait the character wishes to expose and making the target spend energy to initiate the social interaction. It has the disadvantage of making the character appear "Boastful" and "Confident" (and, possibly, silly).

Characters may opt for the very difficult technique of Intriguing, keeping their distance from the target and letting the target notice them on their own. This has the advantage of only exposing a Trait the character wishes to expose and making the target spend energy to initiate the social interaction. It has the disadvantage of risking the character not being noticed at all and spending the interaction uselessly - Charm increases the chance of being noticed. If the character IS noticed, they gain Interst due to seeming mysterious and aloof.

The final method of approaching a target is to get someone else - a wingman - approach the target and just bring the character along. This depends on someone being roped in to play the role of the wingman and paying the price of some other approach (usually a Polite Introduction) and allowing the character to play Intriguing technique while ensuring they are seen.

## Seduction
Seduction consists in a character making themself interesting to a target. Seduction doesn't have to be sexual or even sensual. Characters can seduce someone into becoming their friend or into hiring them.

When Seducing a target, a character will attempt to Reveal Traits the target likes and avoid Revealing Traits the target dislikes.

Learning about a target's likes and dislikes cna be useful, but more often than not, characters don't take the time to do that.

Flirting is just Seduction with the express purpose of initiating a romantic or sexual interaction.
