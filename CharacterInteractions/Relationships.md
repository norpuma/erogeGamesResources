# Relationships
Characters that interact form relationships. These track the impressions, the feelings and the history of actions between two characters.

Relationships are always one-directional and track the perspective of one character towards the other. E.g.: If Alice meets Bob, the character Alice has a relationship to Bob (Alice.relationships[Bob]) which tracks how she views their relation and how she feels about Bob. There is a second and entirely separate relationship that is part of the Bob character (Bob.relationships[Alice]) tracking how Bob Views the relationship and how he feels about Alice.

## Getting Acquainted - Creating Relationships
Characters may make the Acquaintance of one another either with Hearing About/Learning Of, Observing, Third Party Introduction or Introduction.

As a character makes a target's Acquaintance, they start creating a Relationship with and a Target Model of the target.

## Components of a Relationship
The Target Model is one of the main components of a Relationship. This represents what a character thinks about a target. There are things they don't actually know (for instance, if they are honest, when first meeting them), but that they may come to believe.

Then, there are the contexts in which the relationship is evaluated: Friendly, Power and Sensual. These are the same contexts as those of Social Interactions (see SocialInteractionsBasics.md).
