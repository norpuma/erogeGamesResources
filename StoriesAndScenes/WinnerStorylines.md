## Story Concepts
Stories are built out of setups, turning points, requirement fulfilling scenes, requirement derived scenes, ending scenes and filler scenes.

Players/Readers will usually remember setups and turning points the most as well as preferred sexy scenes. Any of the scenes listed before can be sexy scenes.

Stories can be built around those turning points, building up circumstances that lead to those turning points and writing scenes that derive from those turning points (often final storylines).

Programmatic/Procedural stories are created from defining setups and turning points and then presenting choices (or no choices) that lead up to requirement fulfilling scenes. Filler scenes should be used only when really needing to extend a story or when they can be sexy scenes when the player may have be for too long with a sexy scene. Requirement derived scenes are only relevant if they are also requirement fulfilling scenes or sexy scenes.

### Winner Story Concepts
Typical turning points for Winner stories are:
- Coerce into Sex: when a Winner forces through guilt, threats, blackmail or other a target to have sex with them;
- Force into Submission: when a Winner gets a previously proud or resistant target into submitting to them for a short while (usually a scene);
- Force into Slavery: when a Winner gets a previously independent target into a situation of regular servitude;
- Expose Corruption: when a Winner gets a target to realize they have been changed, usually corrupted, in some way;
- Overcome Limitation: when a Winner gets a target to overcome whta was previously a limitation, a taboo or cross some moral line that was, previously unthinkable;
