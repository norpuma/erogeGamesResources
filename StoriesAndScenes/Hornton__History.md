## A Brief History for New Comers to the World
Up to 2010, the history of the world where Hornton exists is very much like ours - with, probably, a few exceptions. In 2010, however, aliens arrive in the world. They do not come in spaceships, they somehow are able to project their thoughs into people in the world and they eventually get bodies of their own, if the bodies used to be a Human's or were created artificially is unknown.

In 2015, the alien's presence is revealed to the world and they world changes. Society collapses. The aliens introduce amazing technology into the world, doling it out at their whim to people who please them. Some technologies are complete game changers and allow some people to become very personally powerful. The aliens themselves establish fiefdoms around the world. Places where they distribute some technologies that provide infrastructure and, there, they establish laws to their followers. The world outside the different alien and human fiefdoms can be quite dangerous.
## Hornton in the Hidden Aliens Era
Hornton is a town on the coast. It is a place of homes, small commerces and a local community college. It has a Teaching Hospital and a small sports arena. The local school burned down in a freak accident and children are forced to attend school in the nearby rival town of Dickins. The Bluepoint is a brand new apartment building and the Dreams Hotel is starting to become a decadent place.

In 2010, mayor John Smith has been recently elected with an education platform, promising to quickly rebuild the local school and was able to institute the Finishing School program, to get young adults to attend complementary civics and some trade teachings to complement what he characterizes as bad and prejudiced against students from Hornton. Principal Gus Claremont leads the new institution.

There are two rich families in town, the Dubois, owners of the Saveston Magazine and the Limelight Recording Studio, and the Griffins, owners of the Blackwood Factory, each owning a mansion and hiring numerous staff.

The town is separated in a few quarters: Sawville, a small industrial quarter; the Gull district, a quarter of warehouses, a cheap motel and a bar, connected to the seaport; Grapes, a district for the middle class, mostly residential, with a diner and a small strip mall, a small café and the Finishing School at its border with the Shelves; the Shelves district, a residential district for the wealthy, with a fancy restaurant; the Greens, a sprawling district that is sparsely populated, bordering both the Shelves and Grapes, this is where the local park, the sports arena, the local teaching hospital and the access to the Sandy Cove beaches can be found; finally, the Spokes district, housing the many of the local offices and services and dominated by Saveston Magazine headquarters.

Whores are not common at this time, but some women can be found selling their virtue by the Nest motel in the Gull District, while an escort service is rumored to attend to the Shelves' healthiest with actual offices in the Spokes.

It is during this period that four aliens find their way into town and start creating their own Cores from which to take control of the town. They corrupt people and create cults, eventually taking control of the town until the final revelation of aliens to the world.


# Uptight Hornton
* Open aliens, Sexuality Suppressed
* Sexuality Enhanced, Pre-slavery
* Sexuality Enhanced, Hidden slavery

In 2018 an accident, called The Event, caused the death of a number of people and made a significant number of orphans. A lot of young couples adopted children, then. There were strong incentives for that. Primary and Middle Schools in Hornton were closed and students had to study at Dickins again, as they had in 2010.

By 2030 the world is quite different. A new normal as been established. Hornton is part of the fiefdom since 2022 of two aliens who established the place, set some laws and became secluded in their own "palaces". One of the aliens keeps a church close to her place and sometimes makes appearances there, the other doesn't make public appearances. The city is walled and lead by a council of Humans with, in theory, no interference by the aliens. The town is not only self-sustained, but it also sustains three other smaller towns around it, including Dickins, and some farms. Children are not allowed in town and everyone between the ages of 18 and 20 must attend Finishing School.

The Council decrees, in 2030, that citizenship to the Gengineered is revoked. Many Gengineered had seen the writing on the wall before that and left Hornton, those that remained are auctioned by the town and become the legal property of a few citizens.

Society is sexually repressed. Feelings of frustration and powerlessness are common. Entertainment comes, mostly, from older works of art, but they remind people of a time before the aliens' arrival a little too often and are seen as somewhat depressing. News come mostly from newssites. People are aware of two of the aliens in town, but they are left to their own devices. People who talk too much about sex are labeled "wanton". Women try not to expose themselves too much. Men and women are discreet when looking for sex. Porn is strictly limited on the Web/Digital Center. Xenotech is feared and tightly regulated. The Night Market sells, mostly, recreational drugs and limited forms of whoring (sexual exposure, groping and handjobs/fingering). The Mage deals from the Night Market, but does not do much business as people fear it.

The Finishing School is a boring place were fun and out-of-the-norm behavior is often squashed. Teachers, like most other citizens, are frustrated and disappointed, feeling forgotten and disrespected in their roles.

The Communal Sports Arena is a place of people try, uselessly, to capture some joy at getting better bodies or that they feel obligated to attend to keep in shape.

The House of Arts is a sad place where movies are shows irregularly, always old pieces that are either too serious or too sad for proper enjoyment. A small class for actors tries uselessly to prepare a play that will interest the townsfolk. Dance classes have been canceled due to lack of interest.

The Recording Studio is used for commercials, some small bands recording songs, some radio-plays and short movies. It is boring and businesslike and only a few actors still think of it as glamorous.

The Night Market has a sad and dangerous feeling to it.

People have simple and somewhat boring dates. They go to the Fancy Restaurant, to the House of Arts and to the SPA. The only place for singles to flirt is at the Bar.

At the start there is little sexual situations going on. The population is mostly uptight and frustrated. People tend to be gloom or irritated.
Relationships are often strained and joyless. There are few drones and robots and almost no AI. Xenotech is used only by the town for a few things and used in a hidden fashion by outlaws.

# Slavery Era Horton
* Open slavery

Society is thoroughly corrupted. Laws changed and citizens can be made into slaves. People talk about sex and scenes of exhibitionism are not uncommon, although they are still frowned upon. Cam shows are a common form of entertainment and cam shows featuring some kind of domination games are becoming common. The Night Market offers quickies in all forms, including blowjobs, vaginal, penetrations, lesbianism and the like. The Starlight Nightclub is very popular. There are rumors of sexual services available at the Dreams Hotel. Xenotech has become desirable, although owners are secretive and there are mostly rumors about their usage.

The Finishing School has become an interesting place where there is a lot happening. Parents are often called over for meetings and regarding students behavior. There is a rumor of a service to train teens in any fashion desired. Many students and teachers have an unusually happy behavior, displaying a strained smile that seems to indicate something is going on.

The Communal Sports Arena is a place where exhibition happens the most. There are constant "accidents" of cocks getting exposed, pants and shirts ripping apart to reveal asses, pussies and tits. Sexy classes are taught, including a lot of pole dancing.

The House of Arts still does not put many interesting shows, although a couple of music concerts drew large crowds. The theater class decided to prepare a very sexy play with lots of costumes (cosplay, really) and fetishes, although they can't decide on a proper narrative. Dance classes have found a surge in popularity, although the dance moves are mostly very sexy and risqué.

The Recording Studio still records for commercials, small band songs, radio-plays and short movies, but it also records cam shows looking for better lighting and backgrounds. Commercials and short movies became sexier and kinkier and actors are willing to show more flesh.

The Night Market became more acceptable and sells slaves at night. Hunters can be hired at the Night Market to capture desired slaves.

At the midway most people in town have been corrupted. Sexual situations abound and there is a lot of powerplay going on. People still switch alliances, not all players are revealed and power is not yet consolidated. Some people may think they left the game, but they are mistaken. People suspect that there is a lot of xenotech in use, but it is still mostly used in hiding.

# New Gamorrah Hornton
* Gomorrah
    * Femdom
    * Black Superiority
    * Demon Era
    * Machine Era

Society has been reshaped by the powers conceded by xenotech. People are divided into masters, wimps and slaves. Streets are cleaned by automated drones and security is provided by high-flying surveillance drones. Middle class citizens ofen hire maids as a sign of status and often turn to whores in the brothel to find an outlet to sexual frustration. Wimps are trained to always obey masters even though they aren't actually slaves. Entertainment comes mostly in the form of porn shot locally. Xenotech can only actually be owned by masters, but their benefit can be enjoyed by most of the population. The greatest masters live in mansions and own harems, but lesser masters can still roam the streets and fuck and command any unowned wimps they come across.

Minds can be reprogrammed and bodies can be reshapen at will, for a fee.

The Finishing School was renamed Social Role Training Center and has become an indoctrination place where the values of society are reinforced in the minds of all youths and many adults are sent there for training. Behavior is moslty trained here. There are master teachers and wimp teachers teaching different behaviors and skills to master students and wimp students. Slaves are mostly trained at the Communal Sports Arena.

The Communal Sports Arena was renamed Slave Training Center and Gym and has become a place to train slaves and to keep in shape with all kinds of sexy classes. Teachers use unusual methods to keep attendees engaged and offer sexy rewards for improvement. Slaves can be trained in sexual skills here.

The House of Arts has been closed. People looking for entertainment go to the Colosseum. People looking for movies watch them at home.

The Colosseum offers entertainment for the masses. Public punishments for slaves and wimps are performed there. Public sex shows to keep the population satisfied. Slave fights also happen there, sexy slave fights were the winner fucks the loser.

The Recording Studio records for commercials always in the nude, small band songs have been replaced by moans from real sex, radio-plays are sexier and kinkier. Short movies are always porn, now, and there are some feature-length porn being shot and edited there as well. Actors are always porn actors, now, although there are both master and wimp actors as well as some slaves for a few parts.

The Night Market was closed. Slave Market became a full-day affair and moved to the mall, while hunters can be hired at the Hunting Lodge to capture slaves.

At the end everyone is corrupted to some level. Power has been cosolidated and society is divided between masters, wimps and slaves. Everyone knows their place and there is not much room to maneuver oneself into a better situation anymore. Xenotech is everywhere and makes society the way it is possible.

- EVENT:* Sex Temples: The Temples of the Goddess change in approach. Only women can become priests. There are new ceremonies with scantily clad women. The temples accept donations. There are some ceremonies of fertility that involve woman/woman or men/woman having sex "on stage" (it is implied that with greater donations there is a greater chance of being part of the rituals). It becomes an outlet for sexual exposition. Women empowerment. Men come to ogle at women and it is seen as worshipping. Men can't give orders to females, there. Females often offer themselves to male. Seeds of femdom society. Secretly, the priestess are studying some techniques of sexual stimulation, becoming able to provide the most intense orgasms with oral and manual sex.

- EVENT: Temple Trained Slaves: The Temple offers pleasure slaves that are already docile. They are, however, deeply religious and push their owners to attend the Temple. Priestess realizes she is losing control over pleasure and joins the slave market. These slaves also tend to be *beautiful* (body magic).
- EVENT:* Raider Attack: The refugee slave was a precursor from a powerful raider attack. They come into the Enclave. Their is physical destruction. Some people are taken away. There are rapes. Demonstrations of physical prowess become more important within the Enclave.
- EVENT:* Slaver Guild: The raid motivates a political movement for a more aggressive outside presence. The economic incentive for those daring to go outside is the capture of slaves. So the Slaver Guild becomes public.
- EVENT:* Mind Programming: Slaves can be submitted to mind programming to change their behavior. This is used to make them programmable and controllable, allowing for aggressive slaves that are also obedient without being docile. Programming relies *a lot* on sexuality. The technology comes out of the Finishing School.
- EVENT:* State Pit Fights: Scarred by the Raider Attack, people want better protection. Slaves are put into pits to demonstrate more aggression. Mind programming is used to control them but it also makes many of the fights rather sexual in nature.
- EVENT:* Body Reshaping: The Temple reveals that they have studied body reshaping magic and make magic allowed under the Temple's guidance. The technocrats react with a policy to *only* allow body reshaping magic and technology for *slaves* in the Enclave. It can change physical attributes, such as breast size, penis size, and other. Slave bodies are made the property of their owners and can be freely reshaped. Gengineered are still impossible, but seem almost unnecessary.
- EVENT:* Women must have Pleasure: Temple passes a rule that ensures women (female citizens, actually) feel pleasure every week. Partners must endeavor to provide pleasure once a week, at least. Increase in toy purchases. The Temple offers classes to ensure female pleasure. The Enclave must provide male slaves for single females on demand.

- EVENT: First Full AI: Business Silvered (Mike) introduces full AI to the Enclave. There are a lot of job losses and people being enslaved for debt.
- EVENT:* Slave Bots:
- EVENT: Enclave Expansion: With increased prosperity, the Enclave is capable of adding a new area and giving everyone greater space. (Free Cities - Add Spire)
- EVENT:* Slave Hunts: With new prosperity and new expansion, more slaves are needed and, oftne, specific slaves are ordered. Slave prices rise and slave hunting becomes more prosperous. Slavers often operate outside of the Enclave with escort bots.
- EVENT:* Male Pleasure Laws: As it is too hard to overthrow the Temple's Female Pleasure Laws, a new set of Male Pleasure Laws are instituted. Males are expected to feel pleasure every two days. Partners must do their best. Slaves can be provided by partners.
- EVENT: Migrant Wave: With prosperity, technology, magic and new pleasure laws, the city sees an uptick in migrants. Slave prices boom as there are not enough slaves for everyone.
- EVENT:* Slave Schoolrooms: With the new migrants, there is, soon a lot of people failing to follow the pleasure laws, many wanton cagings and lots of people enslaved by debt. There is an "education" crisis and schoolrooms, first for criminals, then, for slaves and, finally, for the whole population are institude to better transmit the new values. Slave prices go DOWN.
- EVENT:* Pleasure Laws for Big Dicks: There is a feeling of too much pressure on the citizens for the pleasure laws. The laws are changed. Women are still ensured pleasure once a week, but only men with "big dicks" are ensured pleasure, but it becomes daily. To deal with frustrated small dicks, they are, by default, caged and remanded to a female keyholder. This (coupled with the chemicals in the water) makes it so that almost all black men are ensured pleasure and almost all white men are caged.
- EVENT:* Pavlovian Reconditioning: The Enclave general AI is given control of implants throughout the region. Those are used to recondition slaves (and, sometimes, even citizen) sexuality and excitement.
- EVENT:* Pet Slaves: Slaves become so common that many are converted into pets. They become puppies, kittens, horseys (riding and drawing carriages), bulls (usually big dick slaves used for breeding and pleasure) and cows (milking of breastmilk and semen).
- EVENT:* Slave Breeding Program and State Milking: There are slave breeding programs. Female slaves can be made to go into hyper-estrus, masturbating frantically and releasing a lot of ova. Male slaves are milked by machines. Bull slaves get to penetrate the slaves for better stimulation. Genes are controlled. Gengineered are reintroduced.
- EVENT:* Supremacism: In a final push, laws are changed so that everyone is caged and only black males can open chastity cages.
- EVENT: AI Revolution: AIs and drones/robots take over the Enclave.
- At the end: Sexual depraved society. Hierarchical society. Black men have big dicks. Men with small dicks are kept in chastity cages and submissive to females. Women with bigger tits are dominant over women with smaller tits. Men with big dicks can fuck any non-taken female. Females chose who takes them, but they often do it out of fear.
